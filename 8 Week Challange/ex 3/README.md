## Problem Statement

Danny realised that he wanted to create a new streaming service that only had food related content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows! Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!

This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions.

## Case Study Questions

**Data Analysis Questions**
**1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?**

````sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS number_of_customers
FROM
    subscriptions;
````

| number_of_customers       |
| ------------------------- |
| 1000                      |

**2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset?**

````sql
SELECT 
    MONTHNAME(start_date) AS month_, COUNT(customer_id) AS count_customers
FROM
    subscriptions
WHERE
    plan_id = 0
GROUP BY MONTH(start_date)
ORDER BY MONTH(start_date);
````

| MONTH   | number_of_customers    |
| ------- |  --------------------- |
| January   |  88                  |
| February  |  68                  |

| November  |  75                  |
| December  |  84                  |

**3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name**

````sql
SELECT 
    s.plan_id,
    p.plan_name,
    COUNT(s.customer_id) AS customer_count

    subscriptions s
        JOIN
    plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE
    s.start_date > '2020-12-31'

| 3       | pro annual    | 63               |
| 4       | churn         | 71               |

**4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?**

````sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS churn,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) / (SELECT 
                    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
                FROM
                    subscriptions)*100,
            1)  AS churn_precent

| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| 307               | 30.7             |

**5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?**

````sql
WITH cte AS (
	SELECT
		customer_id,

		MAX(start_date) AS max_date
	FROM
		subscriptions
	WHERE
