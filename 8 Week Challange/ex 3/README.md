## Problem Statement

Danny realised that he wanted to create a new streaming service that only had food related content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows! Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!

This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions.

## Case Study Questions

**Data Analysis Questions**
**1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?**

````sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS number_of_customers
FROM
    subscriptions;
````

| number_of_customers       |
| ------------------------- |
| 1000                      |

**2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset?**

````sql
SELECT 
    MONTHNAME(start_date) AS month_, COUNT(customer_id) AS count_customers
FROM
    subscriptions
WHERE
    plan_id = 0
GROUP BY MONTH(start_date)
ORDER BY MONTH(start_date);
````

| MONTH   | number_of_customers    |
| ------- |  --------------------- |
