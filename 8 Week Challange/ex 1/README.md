# Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner 
## Problem Statement

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

## Case Study Questions

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT 
    s.customer_id, SUM(m.price) AS total_spend
FROM
    sales s
        JOIN
    menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id;
````

| customer_id | total_spend |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT 
    customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS num_of_days

ORDER BY 1;
````
| customer_id | num_of_days |

FROM
    sales s
        JOIN
    menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
