# Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner 
## Problem Statement

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

## Case Study Questions

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

```RUBY
SELECT 
    s.customer_id, SUM(m.price) AS total_spend
FROM
    sales s
        JOIN
    menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id;
```
