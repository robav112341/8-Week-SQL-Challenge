# Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner 
## Problem Statement

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

## Case Study Questions

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT 
    s.customer_id, SUM(m.price) AS total_spend
FROM
    sales s
        JOIN
    menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id;
````

| customer_id | total_spend |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT 
    customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS num_of_days
FROM
    sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY 1;
````
| customer_id | num_of_days |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 4           |
| B           | 5           |
| C           | 6           |

**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**

````sql
SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    MIN(s.order_date) AS first_purch,
    m.product_name
FROM
    sales s
        JOIN
    menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id;
````

| customer_id | first_purch | product_name|
| ----------- | ------------| ----------  |
| A           | 2021-01-01  | sushi       |
| B           | 2021-01-01  | curry       |
| C           | 2021-01-01  | ramen       |

**4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**

````sql
WITH cte AS (
	SELECT
		product_id,
		COUNT(*) AS total
	FROM
		sales
    GROUP BY product_id) 
SELECT
	m.product_name,
	c.product_id,
	c.total
FROM
	cte c
JOIN 
	menu m
ON c.product_id = m.product_id
WHERE total = (SELECT MAX(total) FROM cte);
````

| product_name | product_id | total |
| -----------  | -----------| ----  |
| A            |     3      |   8   |

**5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?**

````sql
WITH cte AS (
	SELECT 
		customer_id,
		product_id,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id, product_id) AS times
FROM
		sales),
count_table AS (
	SELECT 
		customer_id,
		product_id,
		MAX(times) as purch_times,
		RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY MAX(times) DESC) AS ranks
	FROM
		cte
	GROUP BY customer_id, product_id)
SELECT
	ct.customer_id,
	m.product_name,
	ct.purch_times
FROM
	count_table ct
JOIN menu m 
	ON ct.product_id = m.product_id
WHERE ct.ranks = 1;
````

| customer_id | product_name | purch_times |
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------  |
| A           | ramen        | 3           |
