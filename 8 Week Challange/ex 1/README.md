# Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner 
## Problem Statement

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

## Case Study Questions

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT 
    s.customer_id, SUM(m.price) AS total_spend
FROM
    sales s
        JOIN
    menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id;
````

| C           | 36          |

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT 
    customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS num_of_days

	c.product_id,
	c.total
FROM
	cte c
JOIN 
	menu m
ON c.product_id = m.product_id
WHERE total = (SELECT MAX(total) FROM cte);
````

| -----------  | -----------| ----  |
| A            |     3      |   8   |

**5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?**

````sql
WITH cte AS (
	SELECT

FROM
		sales),
count_table AS (
	SELECT

| C           | ramen        | 3           |

**6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**

````sql
WITH min_date AS (
	SELECT 
		s.customer_id, MIN(s.order_date) AS order_date
	FROM
		sales s
	JOIN
		members m ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
        AND s.order_date >= m.join_date
	GROUP BY s.customer_id)
SELECT
	s.*,
	m.product_name
FROM
	sales s
JOIN min_date mn ON s.customer_id = mn.customer_id AND s.order_date = mn.order_date
JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id 
ORDER BY s.customer_id;
````

| customer_id | order_date   | product_id  | product_name|
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------  |-------------|
| A           | 2021-01-07   | 2           |  curry      |

**7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**

````sql
WITH max_date AS (
	SELECT 
		s.customer_id, 
		MAX(s.order_date) AS order_date
	FROM
		sales s
	JOIN
		members m ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
        AND s.order_date < m.join_date
	GROUP BY s.customer_id),
rank_table AS (	
	SELECT
		s.*,
		m.product_name,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ) AS row_num,
		LEAD(s.order_date) OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id) AS if_null
	FROM
		sales s
	JOIN max_date md ON s.customer_id = md.customer_id AND s.order_date = md.order_date
	JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id )
SELECT
    customer_id,
    product_id,
    product_name,
    order_date

    rank_table
WHERE if_null IS NULL;
````

| customer_id | product_id   | product_name | order_date  |
| ----------- | ------------ | -----------  |-------------|
| A           | 2            |  curry       |  2021-01-01 |

    COUNT(*) AS prod_num,
    SUM(mn.price) AS sum_amount
FROM
    sales s
        JOIN
    members m ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
        AND s.order_date < m.join_date
        JOIN
    menu mn ON s.product_id = mn.product_id

ORDER BY 1;
````
| customer_id | prod_num     | sum_amount   | 
| ----------- | ------------ | -----------  |
| A           | 2            |  25          |  
| B           | 3            |  40          |

**9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?**

````sql
SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    COUNT(*) AS count_orders,
    SUM(CASE
        WHEN m.product_name = 'sushi' THEN m.price * 20
        ELSE m.price*10
    END) AS points
FROM
    sales s
        JOIN
    menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY 1;
````

| customer_id | count_orders | points    | 
| ----------- | ------------ | --------  |
| A           | 6            |  860      |  
| B           | 6            |  940      |
| C           | 3            |  360      |

**10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?**

````sql
SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    COUNT(*) AS count_orders,
    SUM(CASE
        WHEN
            s.order_date >= m.join_date
                AND s.order_date < DATE_ADD(m.join_date, INTERVAL 7 DAY)
                AND mn.product_name != 'sushi'
        THEN
            mn.price * 20
        WHEN mn.product_name = 'sushi' THEN mn.price * 20
        ELSE mn.price * 10
    END) AS points
FROM
    sales s
        JOIN
    menu mn ON s.product_id = mn.product_id
        JOIN
    members m ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
````

| customer_id | count_orders | points    | 
| ----------- | ------------ | --------  |
| A           | 6            |  1370     |  
| B           | 6            |  940      |
