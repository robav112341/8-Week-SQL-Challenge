## Business Task
Danny launched a new initiative, Data Bank which runs **banking activities** and also acts as the world‚Äôs most secure distributed **data storage platform**!

Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts. 

The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.

This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!

**Table 1: `regions`**

This regions table contains the `region_id` and their respective `region_name` values.

**Table 2: `customer_nodes`**

Customers are randomly distributed across the nodes according to their region. This random distribution changes frequently to reduce the risk of hackers getting into Data Bank‚Äôs system and stealing customer‚Äôs money and data!

**Table 3: Customer Transactions**

This table stores all customer deposits, withdrawals and purchases made using their Data Bank debit card.

## Case Study Questions

### üè¶ A. Customer Nodes Exploration

**1. How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?**

```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT node_id) count_nodes
FROM
    customer_nodes;
```

| count_nodes |
|-------------|
|      5      |

**2.  What is the number of nodes per region?**

```sql
SELECT 
    r.region_name, COUNT(DISTINCT node_id) AS node_count
FROM
    customer_nodes cn
        JOIN
    regions r ON cn.region_id = r.region_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

| region_name | node_count |
|-------------|------------|
| Africa      | 5          |
| America     | 5          |
| Asia        | 5          |
| Australia   | 5          |
| Europe      | 5          |

**3. How many customers are allocated to each region?**

non-unique customers:

```sql
SELECT 
    r.region_name, COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM
    customer_nodes cn
        JOIN
    regions r ON cn.region_id = r.region_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

| region_name | customer_count |
|-------------|----------------|

| Europe      | 616            |

unique customers:

```sql
SELECT 
    r.region_name, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM
    customer_nodes cn
        JOIN
    regions r ON cn.region_id = r.region_id

    ROUND(AVG(DATEDIFF(end_date, start_date)), 2) AS avg_node_time
FROM
    customer_nodes
WHERE
    end_date != '9999-12-31';
```

| avg_node_time |
|-------------- |
|     14.63     |

**5. What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?**

```sql
WITH percentile_cte AS (
	SELECT 
		*, 	
		DATEDIFF(end_date, start_date) AS avg_time,
		ROUND(PERCENT_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region_id ORDER BY DATEDIFF(end_date, start_date)),1) AS percentile

	FROM
		customer_nodes
	WHERE
		end_date != '9999-12-31')
SELECT 
	r.region_name,
	ROUND(AVG(pc.avg_time),2) AS avg_node_time,
	pc.percentile
FROM
	percentile_cte pc
JOIN
	regions r ON pc.region_id = r.region_id
WHERE pc.percentile = 0.5 OR pc.percentile = 0.8 OR pc.percentile = 0.9
GROUP BY 1, 3
ORDER BY 1, 3;
```

```sql
WITH type_count AS(
	SELECT
		customer_id,
        MONTH(txn_date) AS month_,

		SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'purchase' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase_c,
        SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'withdrawal' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS withdrawal_C
	FROM
        customer_transactions 
	GROUP BY 1,2
    ORDER BY 1)
SELECT
  month_,
  COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM type_count
WHERE deposit_c > 1 
  AND (purchase_c >= 1 OR withdrawal_c >= 1)

| 3      | 192            |
| 4      | 70             |

**4. What is the closing balance for each customer at the end of the month? Also show the change in balance each month in the same table output.**

```sql
WITH month_sum AS(
	SELECT 
		customer_id,
		MONTH(txn_date) AS _month,
		SUM(CASE
			WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount
			ELSE - txn_amount
			END) AS monthly_change
	FROM
		customer_transactions
	GROUP BY 1 , 2
	ORDER BY 1 , 2)
SELECT 
*,
sum(monthly_change) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id
                                     ORDER BY _month ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED preceding AND CURRENT ROW) AS balance
FROM month_sum;
```
the answer is 1720 rows long, therefore i posting only the first 20:
