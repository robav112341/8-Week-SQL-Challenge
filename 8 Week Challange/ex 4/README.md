## Business Task
Danny launched a new initiative, Data Bank which runs **banking activities** and also acts as the world‚Äôs most secure distributed **data storage platform**!

Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts. 

The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.

This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!

**Table 1: `regions`**

This regions table contains the `region_id` and their respective `region_name` values.

**Table 2: `customer_nodes`**

Customers are randomly distributed across the nodes according to their region. This random distribution changes frequently to reduce the risk of hackers getting into Data Bank‚Äôs system and stealing customer‚Äôs money and data!

## Case Study Questions

### üè¶ A. Customer Nodes Exploration

**1. How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?**

```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT node_id) count_nodes
FROM
    customer_nodes;
```

| count_nodes |
|-------------|
|      5      |

**2.  What is the number of nodes per region?**

```sql
SELECT 
    r.region_name, COUNT(DISTINCT node_id) AS node_count
FROM
    customer_nodes cn
        JOIN
    regions r ON cn.region_id = r.region_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

| region_name | node_count |
|-------------|------------|
| Africa      | 5          |
| America     | 5          |
| Asia        | 5          |
| Australia   | 5          |
| Europe      | 5          |

**3. How many customers are allocated to each region?**
non-unique customers:

```sql
SELECT 
    r.region_name, COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM
    customer_nodes cn
        JOIN
    regions r ON cn.region_id = r.region_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

| region_name | customer_count |
|-------------|----------------|
| Africa      | 714            |
| America     | 735            |
| Asia        | 665            |
| Australia   | 770            |
| Europe      | 616            |

unique customers:

```sql
SELECT 
    r.region_name, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM
    customer_nodes cn
        JOIN
    regions r ON cn.region_id = r.region_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

| region_name | customer_count |
|-------------|----------------|
| Africa      | 102            |
| America     | 105            |
| Asia        | 95             |
